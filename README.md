# WTF Pathfinder

Inspired by [Ryan Grant's](https://twitter.com/ryanjgrant) [Who the fuck is my DND character?](http://whothefuckismydndcharacter.com/), I decided to create a spin-off tailored to the Pathfinder system, creatively titled "Who the Fuck is my Pathfinder Character?!".

The core functionality is the same, but with expanded race and class lists from the Pathfinder game setting. I also tried my best to create generation lists that were as unique as possible from WTFDND, but there are a few that I ended up copying and some that are very similar due to the nature of the ideas. So please check out both generators for maximum combinations and ideas.

The basic functionality has been implemented, and I am working on some new features unique to WTFPathfinder such as the ability to dynamically pick and choose sublists for generation to narrow the space of all combinations; an example being choosing to have / not have the races from the Advanced Race guide.

# WTF Engine

This was built using the [WTFCoffeeEngine](https://github.com/watsyurname529/WTFCoffeeEngine), which is my own implementation of the [WTFEngine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine/) created by [soulwire](https://github.com/soulwire) back in 2011. Both are fairly simple tools to create similar WTF sites for any idea one could think of.
