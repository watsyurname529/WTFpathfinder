# WTF Engine

Inspired by [WhatTheFuckShouldIMakeForDinner.com](http://whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/), in 2011 [soulwire](https://github.com/soulwire) made [WhatTheFuckIsMyMashup.com](http://whatthefuckismymashup.com/) and released this simple tool, the [WTFEngine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine/), for generating similar websites.

It's very simple to use and now allows you to populate it using either vanilla JavaScript objects, JSON files or direct feeds from Google spreadsheets.

# WTF Pathfinder

Building on the work of others, I am toying around with my take of the WTFEngine to create a spin-off / rip-off of (Ryan Grant's)[https://twitter.com/ryanjgrant] (Who the fuck is my DND character?)[http://whothefuckismydndcharacter.com/] tailored to the Pathfinder system, creatively titled "Who the Fuck is my Pathfinder Character?".

In the mean time while I mess around and get this started, please visit the aformentioned WTF DND character generator or make your own WTF site using the WTFEngine.
